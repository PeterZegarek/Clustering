Question 1:
    1a. The k-means algorithm makes the assumptions that all the data is a double, each line of data is of the same dimension, there is a
    predifined number of clusters beforehand, and Euclidean distance can be calculated from the data.
    1b. 
    1c.
    1d. 

Question 2:
    2a. The iterated use allows with its randomness allows us to see more varied and possible better results with each iteration.  The more iterations there are the more of a chance of better results because of the randomness. 
    2b. The iterated sample run appears to succeed for bullseye2, diffdensity2, diffstddev2, easygaussian1, easygaussian2, easygaussian3, easygaussian4, hardgaussian1, hardgaussian2, hardgaussian3, hardgaussian4, hardgaussian5, and stretched2.
    2c. This iterated approach helps different density, differnet standard deviation, stretched, and sometime gaussian problems.
