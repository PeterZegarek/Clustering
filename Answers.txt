Question 1:
    1a. The k-means algorithm makes the assumptions that all the data is a double, each line of data is of the same dimension, there is a
    predifined number of clusters beforehand, and Euclidean distance can be calculated from the data.
    1b. 
    1c. 
    1d. Yes, K-means clustering can fail even if assumptions are not violated. WHY?
