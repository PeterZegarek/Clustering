Question 1:
    1a. The k-means algorithm makes the assumptions that all the data is a double, each line of data is of the same dimension, there is a
    predifined number of clusters beforehand, and Euclidean distance can be calculated from the data.
    1b. 
        Always Succeed - bullseye2, diffdensity2, diffstddev2, easygaussian1, easygaussian2, easygaussian3, easygaussian5, hardgaussian1,
        hardgaussian2, hardgaussian3, hardgaussian5, hardgaussian8
        Sometimes Succeed - easygaussian4, easygaussian6, easygaussian7, easygaussian9, hardgaussian4, hardgaussian6, hardgaussian7
        Never Succeed - easygaussian8
    1c. 
    1d. Yes, K-means clustering can fail even if assumptions are not violated. WHY?
